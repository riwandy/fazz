# Xfers Frontend Take Home Test

## Getting Started
- Create a fork of this repository
- Complete the requirements based on the evaluation criteria on your fork of the repository
- Once you're done, make sure to push your commits onto your fork and inform your recruiter. The engineering team will then review your assignment.

## Requirements
- You can complete the assignment either with the use of VueJs or ReactJs
- You can either create your own UI components or use online UI library (eg: Bootstrap / Material / Antd)

## Assignment
- Build a frontend SPA with a table that displays bank data: https://github.com/fazz-interviews/frontend-bank-list/blob/main/bank.json
  - The table displays 10 records per page
  - The table allows users to filter the data with a date range filter
  - The table allows the data to be sorted by date
  - The table allows text search by description
- Each row of the table should have a "Details" button
  - Upon clicking the button, users will be navigated to the details page
  - Detail page should display all information of the transaction
- If the API above is invalid, you can use the mock data in `./bank.json`.

## Coding skills assessment
- Class and method names should clearly show their intent and responsibility
- Folder and files for data and UI components should be abstracted and organized
- Your solution should easily accommodate possible future requirement changes
- (Bonus points) Using TypeScript for type checking
- (Bonus points) Writing test cases for the components
- (Bonus points) Using Redux for state management
